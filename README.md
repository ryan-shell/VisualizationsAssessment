# VisualizationsAssessment
The main goal of this project is to work with the Annual Business Survey API. In this API there are several different endpoints that are
available. The endpoints were used in this project to get the data that we wanted to use to create several different visualizations. The data
that was collected from the endpoints was then loaded into a dataframe, which could then be used to create visualizations from
